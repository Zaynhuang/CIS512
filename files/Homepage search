-- The Homepage presents a search bar where the user can specify either NBA or NCAA to specify
-- what player they're looking for, before entering the name of the player into the search bar.
-- Assume @SearchType is the specified type of search and @UserQuery is what's written in the
-- search bar. The query spits out a player_id that the web app uses to navigate to that player page.

DECLARE @SearchType VARCHAR(50); -- Either 'NBA' or 'NCAA'
DECLARE @UserQuery VARCHAR(255); -- User input in the search bar
